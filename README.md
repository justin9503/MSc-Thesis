The primary objective of this thesis is to improve the performance of predictive models in the healthcare industry by integrating XGBoost optimization with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the Firefly algorithm using three datasets: Maternal Health Risk, Student Mental Health, and Breast Cancer. we compare the optimized models to the XGBoost base model. This thesis’s findings demonstrate that the XGBoost model’s performance is improved by both PSO and the Firefly algorithm, with the Particles Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm providing the best outcomes. This study highlights the potential of applying optimization
algorithms to increase healthcare prediction ability, which can help in identifying at-risk patients, improving diagnoses, Treatment, and improving patient outcomes
generally. In addition to analyzing the performance of our models, we explore both the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing machine learning (ML) in healthcare.
